Notes on creating HiPS maps:

* hips_gen.py

Makes HiPS images for each band. Makes cts and exp images, then computes rates image.

Units of cts: cts/arcsec^2
Units of exp: s
Units of rate: cts/s/arcsec^2

* build_moc.py

Builds a MOC for each HiPS map.

* make_hdr.py

Make a header properties file for each map
